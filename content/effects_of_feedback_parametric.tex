\chapter{Rider control identification in bicycling under lateral perturbations using a gray box approach} \label{hapticFB}

\section{Introduction}

Balancing a bicycle in motion is an acquired skill which is poorly understood. From the first appearance of the modern bicycle in the late 1880s until now, dynamic models of uncontrolled bicycles have provided fundamental insight into bicycle stability in relation to speed and geometry\cite{meijaard2007linearized, kooijman2011bicycle}. Further research into human control is needed to design safer bicycles and explore the potential of new safety systems.  In depth-analysis of the rider sensory dynamics  including delays and thresholds are necessary to probe the dynamics of the rider-bicycle balance control mechanism.

Research in the field of cybernetics started in the 1950s to advance aircraft technology and understand pilot control. \citet{mcruer1959human} were one of the first who tried to model the human operator as a servo system element with  time delay. The so called "McRuer cross over model" was later extended to the "McRuer precision model" which accounted for low frequency neuromuscular lags \cite{mcruer1967manual}.  Results showed that the human tries to adapt its control strategy in order to achieve a first order integrator open loop transfer function  near the systems cross-over frequency. Among the first researchers who focused on the manual control of bicycles were \citet{van1970influence}. They used a stationary bicycle simulator and system identification techniques to identify the rider control at a constant speed of 4.2 m/s . They described the rider as a proportional– integral–derivative (PID) position controller with delay. Although, their results are questionable since the bicycle simulator had no visual display and the obtained controller has not been experimentally validated. Roland et al. \cite{roland1971massing, roland1973computer} developed a bicycle stability and path following torque controller. The controller consisted of an inner and outer loop responsible for roll stabilization and lateral tracking, respectively. The stabilization controller was described as a PID with delay, whereas the tracking controller as a simple proportional controller. Results showed adequate performance but validation of the simulated responses has not been examined yet. \citet{weir1973manual} developed a cross-over model for Sharp's  \cite{sharp1971stability} motorcycle model in order to identify the transfer functions of the various control input–output relations. He concluded that steer torque response to lean angle error is the easiest way to balance a motorcycle in motion. \citet{eaton1975man} later conducted experiments to validate both the theoretical motorcycle model of  \citet{sharp1971stability} and rider model of \citet{weir1973manual} . Despite the fact that, he excluded the lean torque and used only the inner roll stabilization loop as a control input, results showed that low uncertainty was present in the estimated control parameters and low discrepancy in the fitting of the steer torque responses. \citet{hess2012modeling} attempted to introduce a task independent handling qualities metric for bicycle control. For this reason, he developed a model with five gains, two fixed second-order filters, and a preview time. \citet{schwab2013} recently  modelled the bicycle rider using lateral force perturbation experiments. A rider control model applying steering torque at the handlebars has been developed to explore the potential feedback of sensory cues during the bicycle balancing task. The identified rider control parameters, after model reduction, stabilize the system and mimic realistic rider control behavior.

The majority of aforementioned modeling approaches represent the rider as a torque controller and incorporate system delays. Albeit, the selected delays do not attribute directly to the physical response time of the visual, vestibular and proprioceptive system. Furthermore, none of these models include any type of internal model control (IMC) as frequently happens in most of human motor control studies \cite{francis1976internal, garcia1982internal, wolpert1995internal, gillespie2016human}. Consequently, the ability of humans to adapt and altered steering dynamics even when feedback is intermittent or delayed has never been examined.  Aside from that, the effect of haptic steering feedback in the balancing of bicycling has never been examined parametrically . Therefore, the role of the sensory receptors and in particular of the proprioception muscle splindes (position feedback) and golgi tendon organs (force feedback) during the riding process remains a black box .

The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of three different control approaches with increased complexity and also examine the effect of  handlebar torque feedback during the steering and balancing task. The performance of all models are compared with the experimentally derived non-parametric finite impulse responses (FIR's) of  \citet{dialynaseffect}. Two metrics are used to assess the performance of the three controllers and to analyse the impact of torque feedback on rider control. The covariance coefficient (CV) of the estimated controller parameters is used as a measure of uncertainty, whereas the variance accounted (VAF) as a measure of fitting between the simulated and actual responses.

% In the lateral perturbation experiments conducted for two experimental conditions (torque feedback on and off), a statistical significant difference for control effort and task performance  could not be discerned. This indicated that the  rider despite the reduced feedback and changed bicycle dynamics managed to compensate and produce similar outputs. For this reason, a gray box analysis is conducted in this work to get further insights on what and why might have led to the findings derived in \cite{dialynaseffect}.

\section{Methods}
  In this work system identification techniques are employed to develop a rider control model and  investigate the effectiveness of torque feedback via a gray box analysis. The ultimate goal is to formulate a model that best simulates bicycle rider balance behavior. This is done by comparing the parametric  results of  three torque feedback level conditions. In the first, the torque feedback loop is part of the rider control model. In the second, it is removed by setting its corresponding gain value to zero. In the third, the effectiveness of torque feedback is reduced by altering the plant dynamics and creating a steering configuration where the forces that would naturally transfer from the front wheel contact point to the handlebars are canceled, similar to how the haptics off case was implemented in the experimental condition \cite{dialynaseffect}. The full methodology is summarized in the list below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Black box identification : the procedure described in \cite{dialynaseffect} is followed to produce impulse response functions (IRFs), through the use of a FIR model, for steering angle \ensuremath{\delta}, roll angle \ensuremath{\phi}, yaw angle \ensuremath{\psi} and steer torque  \ensuremath{T_\delta} for four forward speed levels (2.8 , 3.6, 4.7, 5.7 \si{m.s^{-1}}). This is done in order to extract the linear relationship between disturbance and measurements effectively filtering intrasubject variability. In the case of \ensuremath{T_\delta} instead of considering the whole bicycle rider closed loop system as a black box, the bicycle rider open loop is chosen with input the disturbance \ensuremath{w} and output the control input \ensuremath{T_\delta} (see \cref{fig:blackbox}).
    \item The produced IRFs \ensuremath{h^\delta(\tau)}, \ensuremath{h^\phi(\tau)}, \ensuremath{h^\psi(\tau)}, \ensuremath{h^{T_\delta}(\tau)} are filtered using zero-phase low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 \si{\hertz}.
    \item The complete dataset is split into a training and a validation subdataset. The IRFs are averaged over each subdataset's participants in order to produce 2 mean rider responses. The variance accounted for \ensuremath{\mathit{VAF}}, between each individual's  response and the mean rider's, is calculated. The rider with the highest  \ensuremath{\mathit{VAF}} for all outputs  across all speed levels  is chosen as the median rider of each dataset. All further parameter estimation is conducted on the response of the median rider of the training dataset. Analysis is chosen to be conducted on the median rider since intersubject variability was low as is shown in \cite{dialynaseffect}.
    \item The IRFs of the median rider are convolved with the measured disturbances of each run to produce the non-parametric output \ensuremath{y_\delta(t)}, \ensuremath{y_\phi(t)}, \ensuremath{y_\psi(t)}, \ensuremath{y_{T_\delta}(t)}.
    \item Investigating the role of steering torque: {
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Zero Delay Model gray box identification: A gray box model  is fit to the measured lateral force and the filtered response of the FIR
            model for each run. This is repeated for three conditions. In the first, the control process dynamics approximate a normal bicycle and will be referred to as haptic feedback on (haptics on), while  the rider has the torque feedback loop connected. In the second, the control process dynamics approximate again a normal bicycle, but the internal torque feedback loop of the rider is severed. In the third condition the steering dynamics change to that of steer-by-wire. This means that the coupling between roll and steer dynamics is modified. The rider is only receiving feedback due to the inertia of the handlebar and motor drive components. This condition is referred to haptic feedback off (haptics off).
            \item Variable Delay Model gray box identification: The model is updated with time delays. The model  is fit to the measured lateral force and the filtered response of the FIR model for each run. This is repeated for the three conditions described above. 
            \item  Variable Delay Reafferent Optimal Prediction (VDROP) Model gray box identification: The gray box model is updated with a delay compensation algorithm. The model is fit to the measured lateral force and the filtered response of the FIR model for each run. This is repeated for the three conditions described above.
            \item Assessment on the importance of torque feedback is made based on the the normalized covariance of the identified gray box parameters and the change of \ensuremath{\mathit{VAF}}  in the lateral force to steer angle fit between conditions.
        \end{enumerate}
    }
   
    \item Assessment on the delay compensation strategy used is made based on the fitting performance across gray box models. Additionally the predictor is compared with a more conventional approach found in motor control literature. Finally the predictive capability of the VDROP model is tested by comparing its results with the median rider of the validation dataset.

\subsection{Bicycle Model}
The bicycle model used is the so called Whipple-Carvalho model the dynamics of which have been expressed in a set of linearized equations by \citet{meijaard2007linearized}. In the original model three assumptions are made. The first is that the rider is rigidly attached in the saddle with the mass of the arms and legs acting as a point. Secondly, the contact between tire and ground is modeled as a non slipping rolling point contact meaning that the wheels can rotate without lateral slip. Lastly it is assumed that the total energy of the system is preserved. The resulting non-holonomic mechanical model has three velocity degrees of freedom, the forward speed, the rear frame roll rate \ensuremath{\dot{\phi}} and the steering rate \ensuremath{\dot{\delta}}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/figure3_1.png}
    \caption{ The Whipple-Carvalho bicycle model consists of four rigid bodies: rear wheel R, rear frame B, front frame H and front wheel F connected via hinges. The center of mass locations are expressed relative to the x - and z -coordinates shown (with origin at P and y pointing towards the reader). The other parameters shown are the steer axis tilt \ensuremath{\lambda}, wheelbase \ensuremath{w} and trail \ensuremath{c}. The model at its most expanded form is described by 25 parameters.\cite{meijaard2007linearized}}
    \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}
The lateral motion is described by  two coupled second order differential equations given by \cref{eq:paper1}.
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{M} \ddot{q}+v \mathbf{C}_{1} \dot{q}+\left[g \mathbf{K}_{0}+v^{2} \mathbf{K}_{2}\right] \mathbf{q}=\mathbf{f}
    \label{eq:paper1}
\end{equation}

where \ensuremath{\mathbf{q}} is a vector containing the roll and steer angles, \ensuremath{\mathbf{f}} is a vector containing the roll and steer torques, \ensuremath{g} is the gravitational acceleration and \ensuremath{\mathbf{M},\;v\mathbf{C}_{1},\;g \mathbf{K}_{0}+v^{2} \mathbf{K}_{2}} are the "mass", "damping" and "stiffness" ratios in matrix form respectively. The entries in the constant coefficient matrices  \ensuremath{\mathbf{M},\mathbf{C}_{1}, \mathbf{K}_{0},  \mathbf{K}_{2}} are calculated from a set of 25 bicycle parameters related to inertial and design properties of the steer by wire bicycle (see \cref{tb:paper1}).

To determine the stability of the open loop system in a straight ahead motion the characteristic polynomial derived from
\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{det}\left(\mathbf{M} \lambda^{2}+v \mathbf{C}_{1} \lambda+g \mathbf{K}_{0}+v^{2} \mathbf{K}_{2}\right)=0
    \label{eq:paper2}
\end{equation}

is solved for a forward speed range from 0 to 10 \si{\meter\per\second} where \ensuremath{\lambda} are the eigenvalues of the system (see \cref{fig:paper2}). The two interesting eigenmodes defined by the locus plot are the weave and capsize. The weave corresponds to an oscillatory mode as can be seen by the existence of imaginary parts and represents a motion in which the bicycle sways about its heading. This oscillatory motion exponentially fades when forward speed is larger than 4.39 \si{\meter\per\second}. The capsize on the other hand has an eigenvector dominated by lean and leads to a gradual roll drift to infinity when the eigenvalue crosses the zero line around 6.67 \si{\meter\per\second}.
\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/root_locus_steerbywire.eps}
    \caption{Root locus plot of the steer by wire bicycle. Dotted blue lines indicate the imaginary part of the eigenvalues while dotted black show the real part. The stable region (marked between the magenta lines) corresponds to speeds  \ensuremath{4.4\lessapprox v \lessapprox 6.2\; \si{\meter\per\second}}}
    \label{fig:paper2}
\end{figure}
Since in the experimental setup the task could not be isolated to purely balance the equations are extended to include heading. Heading rate \ensuremath{\dot{\psi}} is defined as a linear combination of steer angle \ensuremath{\delta} and steer rate \ensuremath{\dot{\delta}} as expressed by \citet{meijaard2007linearized} in \cref{eq:paper3}. 

\begin{equation}
    \dot{\psi}=\frac{v \delta+c \dot{\delta}}{w} \cos \lambda
    \label{eq:paper3}
    \end{equation}

When modeling the haptics off case of the steer-by-wire bicycle the dynamics of the plant need to change accordingly. In that configuration, the forcing steering input is directly proportional to steering acceleration, for this reason the  constant coefficient matrices of \ref{eq:paper1} become :

\begin{align}
\begin{array}{l}{\mathbf{M}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}{{M}_{11}} & {{M}_{12}} \\ {0} & {I_{F_{xx}}}\end{array}\right], \quad \mathbf{C}_{1}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}{0} & {{C_1}_{\scriptscriptstyle 12}} \\ {0} & {0}\end{array}\right]} \\ {\mathbf{K}_{0}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}{{K_0}_{\scriptscriptstyle 11}} & {{K_0}_{\scriptscriptstyle 12}}  \\ {0} & {0}\end{array}\right], \quad \mathbf{K}_{2}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}{0} & {{K_2}_{\scriptscriptstyle 12}} \\  {0} & {0}\end{array}\right]}\end{array}
\end{align}
where \ensuremath{I_{F_{xx}}} is the moment of inertia of the  decoupled upper handlebar assembly (see \cref{tb:paper1}).
 
For control purposes \cref{eq:paper1} is expressed in state space form with state vector \ensuremath{\mathbf{x}=[\dot{\phi}, \dot{\delta}, \phi, \delta, \psi]^{T}}, forcing input \ensuremath{\mathbf{f}=T_{\delta}} and output equal to the full state. The  bike is assumed to be controlled only by a steering torque because according to both \citet{moore2012human} and \citet{weir1973manual}  the rear frame roll angle is mainly
 controlled by steering. 
 \begin{align}
    \dot{\mathbf{x}} &=\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}+\mathbf{B} T_\delta + \mathbf{H}_d w
     \label{eq:bikeEOM1}\\
    \mathbf{y}&=\mathbf{C} \mathbf{x}+\mathbf{D} T_\delta
    \label{eq:bikeEOM2}
\end{align}

where matrices \ensuremath{A,B,C,D,H_d} are defined by:
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{A} &=\begin{bmatrix}
        -\mathbf{M}^{-1}v\mathbf{C}_{1} & -\mathbf{M}^{-1}(g \mathbf{K}_{0}+v^{2}\mathbf{K}_{2}) \\
        {\mathbf{I}_2}                    & {\mathbf{0}} \\  {\begin{matrix} {0} & { \frac{c\cdot cos\lambda}{w}}\end{matrix}} &  {\begin{matrix} 0 & { \frac{v \cdot cos\lambda}{w}}\end{matrix} } 
    \end{bmatrix} , \mathbf{B}=\left[ \begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{M}^{-1}} \\ {\mathbf{0}}\end{array}\right] \\
    \mathbf{C} &= {\mathbf{I}_5} , \mathbf{D}=\mathbf{0} \\
    \mathbf{H}_d &= \left[ \begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{M}^{-1}}{\begin{bmatrix} l_g \\ c_s\end{bmatrix} }  \\ {\mathbf{0}}\end{array}\right] 
\end{align}

\ensuremath{\mathbf{H}_d} is the matrix defining the dynamics of the lateral disturbance \ensuremath{w}. In this case the force application point was \ensuremath{l_g} distance from the ground. The constant \ensuremath{c_s} coefficient is due to the coupled roll to steer dynamics and is selected as a fraction of \ensuremath{w} similar to \citet{schwab2013}. This results in an additional  torque perturbation \ensuremath{T_\delta } in the handlebars.

\subsection{Rider Control Model}\label{subsec:rider_model}

 The complete high level overview of the model is shown in \cref{fig:paper3}. The output state of the bicycle is concatenated with the steering torque to produce the complete vector of sensory inflow. The measurements attributed to the vestibular, visual and proprioceptive system of the human body are delayed and fed into a prediction algorithm that uses an internal model of the process dynamics to forward the measurements in time. This is made possible by the use of the efference copy, which is an internal copy of an outflowing, movement-producing signal generated by the motor system. The controller  is just a pure gain block with free parameters to be estimated through gray box system identification. The final control forcing input is produced after passing through a transfer function simulating the neuromuscular dynamics.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \captionsetup{justification=centering,margin=2cm}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{images/high_level_block.pdf}
    \caption{Block diagram of the complete rider-bicycle model.} 
    \label{fig:paper3}
\end{figure}

The neuromuscular dynamics block works as a second order filter to simulate the limitations of the human response. In state space form this block is expressed by :

\begin{align}
\dot{x}_{nm} &= \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\ -{\omega_c}^2 & -2\zeta{\omega_c}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} T_\delta \\ \dot{T}_\delta\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ {\omega_c}^2\end{bmatrix} a     \label{eq:gnmBLOCKA}    
    \\
y_{nm} &= \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} T_\delta \\ \dot{T}_\delta\end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:gnmBLOCKB}
\end{align}

where \ensuremath{a} is the controller output representing the efferent neural signal, \ensuremath{\zeta} is the damping coefficient and \ensuremath{\omega_c} is the cutoff frequency. The latter two   parameters are chosen according to muscular activation dynamics present in the shoulder joint \cite{happee2008posture}.

The steer angle \(\delta\) and steer rate \(\dot{\delta}\) feedback is attributed to the muscle spindles, while the torque feedback is made possible with the help of the golgi tendon organs. The roll and heading angle come from the visual system. Lastly the roll rate feedback is attributed to the vestibular system but it may also result from vision. 

The bicycle model of \cref{eq:bikeEOM1,eq:bikeEOM2} is combined with the neuromuscular dynamics block of \cref{eq:gnmBLOCKA,eq:gnmBLOCKB} to create a combined  plant with state \ensuremath{x=[\dot{\phi}, \dot{\delta}, \phi, \delta, \psi, T_\delta \dot{T}_\delta]^{T}} ,input \ensuremath{a} and \ensuremath{w} and output \ensuremath{y=[\dot{\phi}, \dot{\delta}, \phi, \delta, \psi, T_\delta]^{T}}. The equivalent model block diagram is shown in \cref{fig:paper4}. In order to make possible the implementation of the predictor which is discrete in nature the state space representation of the combined plant is discretized by zero order hold with a time step of 0.005 \si{\second}. For a look into how this time step affects simulation integration error refer to \cref{fig:convergence}. Additionally, in order to make the measured  and parametric ouptut signals comparable with simulation, they are resampled from 1000 \si{hz} to 200 \si{hz}. 

\subsubsection{The variable delay reafferent optimal predictor}
Neuromuscular delays prohibit effective (high bandwidth) motor control. Hence a range of studies propose the CNS to employ control strategies
that compensate for the effect of time delays through feedforward elements. The most basic predictor is the Smith predictor, which has been explored in motor control research by \citet{miall1993cerebellum}. The Smith predictor compensates for time delays through the use of an internal forward model of the controlled dynamics and an internal model of the sensory delay pathways. The forward model works by utilizing an efferent signal of the control input while the comparison between prediction and measurement is trying to simulate the human's ability to distinguish between reafference and exafference.  Unfortunately the  most basic Smith predictor scheme does not work for unstable open loop systems \cite{smith1957closed}. In this work a modification to the normal Smith predictor scheme is suggested. In place of the forward model a discrete optimal predictor  (DOP) is used that forward simulates the amount of steps according to the model of sensory delay (see \cref{fig:delay_line}). This works like a resetting forward model that is updated every time step by the delayed state so the predictor loop does not become unstable. Because every sensory pathway has different delay, the conventional DOP is adapted to work with a variable time delayed state input. This adapatation is illustrated with a simplified example in the block scheme of \cref{fig:VDROP_line}.  The DOP   without the Smith  correction can still work and has been implemented by \citet{van2001adaptive} for modeling stance control but it leads to predictions that do not contain any reaction to the effect of the disturbance on the state. The block diagram of the predictor can be seen in \cref{fig:paper4}.

It then compares this prediction  with the desired setpoint \ensuremath{r} to decide what adjustments are needed (control \ensuremath{u}). To prevent drifting and reject external disturbances, the Smith predictor also compares the actual process output with a prediction \ensuremath{\hat{y}_d} that takes the dead time into account. The gap \ensuremath{y_e=y_d-\hat{y}_d} is fed back  and contributes to the overall controller input. Note that \ensuremath{y_e} amounts to the perceived state mismatch delayed by the duration of dead time.}

The delayed output measurement  is forwarded in time (\ensuremath{d_{max}} times) in the tapped delay line to produce the first undelayed estimate of the output \ensuremath{\hat{y}^p}. When a less delayed measurement  of a certain state becomes available the tapped delay line  state register is updated with that measurement. This way the accumulation of forward simulation error is minimized. Output \ensuremath{\hat{y}^p} is again delayed through a model of the  internal time delay. The difference between this re-delayed prediction with the delayed measurements creates the error \ensuremath{e} which is added back to  \ensuremath{\hat{y}^p}  to create the final corrected prediction \ensuremath{\hat{y}^c}. Finally, \ensuremath{\hat{y}^c} is fed into the pure gain block \ensuremath{K}, the parameters of which are estimated through the gray box optimization procedure, which produces the control input \ensuremath{a}, representing the neural signal sent to the muscles.}

\subsection{Parameter Estimation }

In order to assess the effectiveness of the torque feedback loop, three models of incremental complexity are used. In the first the feedback pathways are fed into the controller without delays. In the second delays are added. The third one compensates for time delays by the use of the VDROP. The three models have the  controller gains as free parameters. More specifically, the gains are estimated by fitting the model output into the non-parametric data-set derived in \cite{dialynaseffect}.  The gains were estimated by minimization of the cost function 
\begin{equation}
    V_{N}(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\frac{1}{N} \mathlarger{\mathlarger{\mathlarger{\sum}}}_{k=1}^{N}\left[0.8\frac{\left(\hat{y}^{\delta}_k(\mathbf{\theta})-y^\delta_k\right)^{2}}{\left(\overline{y}^{\delta}_k\right)^2}+0.16\frac{\left(\hat{y}^{\psi}_k(\mathbf{\theta})-y^\psi_k\right)^{2}}{\left(\overline{y}^{\psi}_k\right)^2}+0.04\frac{\left(\hat{y}^{T_\delta}_k(\mathbf{\theta})\right)^2}{\left(\overline{y}^{T_\delta}_k\right)^2}\right]
    \label{eq:cost}
    \end{equation}

where \ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\theta}} is a vector containing all the free parameters, \ensuremath{\hat{y}^{\delta}} and \ensuremath{\hat{y}^{\psi}} are the outputs of the simulation for the measured external disturbance \ensuremath{w} and the vector of parameters  \ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\theta}} for steer angle \ensuremath{\delta} and heading angle \ensuremath{\psi}  respectively, while \ensuremath{y^\delta} and \ensuremath{y^\psi} are the outputs of the non-parametric model. Finally \ensuremath{\overline{y}^{\delta}_k,\overline{y}^{\psi}_k,\overline{y}^{T_\delta}_k} are the absolute maximum allowable values of the  signals and are equal to 0.4 \si{\radian}, 0.4 \si{\radian} and 10 \si{N.m} respectively.

The first two terms  of the cost function are trying to match the steering and heading  response of the parametric model with that one of the non-parametric model, while the third on minimizes the amount of input torque generated in order to produce the best possible fit while maintaining minimal control effort. The weights are chosen heuristically. The weight factor between yaw and steer error is chosen as 1:5 as it is found that this gives the best possible imporovment in roll and yaw fit with no major drop in steering angle fit.  For optimization the genetic algorithm with a fitness limit of 0.03 is first  used in order to produce a good starting parameter vector for gradient descend algorithm to take over, which finally finds the closest possible estimate of the global minimum. For the genetic algorithm a crossover fraction of 0.85  along with a population size 10 times the length of the parameter vector is used.

The gains attributed to the muscle spindle sensors (\ensuremath{K_\delta} and \ensuremath{K_{\dot{\delta}}}) are constrained to be only positive. The assumption is that they work like a delayed steering stiffness and damping. Additionally, the gains \ensuremath{K_\psi} and \ensuremath{K_\phi}  are constrained to fall between -250 and 250 \si{\kilogram\square\meter\per\second}.  When left unconstrained these parameters drive the whole gain vector to unrealistic values for insignificant amount of fitting performance increase (\ensuremath{<0.1\%}).

The impulse response function of the median rider is used. This is determined by taking the mean impulse response function of each measured output and finding the participant which had the highest variance accounted for between the individual response and the mean across all speed levels for all filtered outputs. Each system was identified for three different model conditions: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  6 feedback pathways including torque feedback
    \item  5 feedback pathways excluding torque feedback
    \item  6 feedback pathways including torque feedback but bicycle dynamics are switch to "haptics off".
\end{enumerate}
In the thrid condition the internal model used in the predictor is not updated to reflect the changed bicycle dynamics. This assumption is made due to the fact that no adaptation time  was noted in the experiments for any of the participants when switching the steering configurations so significant tuning of an internal model is not realistic. 

 As metric of model validity the variance accounted for between parametric and non-parametric output is used, defined as
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{VAF_d}(\boldsymbol{\theta})=1 -\sum_{k=1}^{n}\left(y^{d}(k)-\hat{y}^{d}(k, \boldsymbol{\theta})\right)^{2} / \sum_{k=1}^{n}\left(y^{d}(k)^{2}\right)
\label{eq:VAF}
\end{equation} 
where \ensuremath{d=\{\phi,\delta,\psi\}}. 

In order to assess the importance of the torque feedback, the uncertainty of each parameter is found. Parameters with the lowest uncertainty contribute more to the fit so they are deemed more important. To find the uncertainty the covariance matrix is estimated from :
\begin{align}
    \operatorname{cov}_{\hat{\theta}}  &=V_N(\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}})\boldsymbol{H}(\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}})^{-1}
    \label{fig:cov_mat}
    \\ \text{with} \;\;\;\;  \boldsymbol{H}(\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}})&= \frac{\partial^{2} V_N}{\partial \theta_{i} \partial \theta_{j}}
\end{align}

where \ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}} is the closest estimate to the true parameter vector \ensuremath{\theta^*} that produces the true global minimum and \ensuremath{\boldsymbol{H}} is the hessian matrix numerically estimated by the gradient descend algorithm.  However, since bigger parameters are going to have naturally larger variances the diagonal values are normalized by the parameter value to produce the coefficient of variation.

\begin{equation}
    CV_{i}=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2}_{\hat{\theta_i}}}{\hat{\theta}_i^2}}
    \end{equation}

    where \ensuremath{\sigma^{2}_{\hat{\theta_i}}} are the diagonal elements of \ensuremath{ \operatorname{cov}_{\hat{\theta}}}.
% As far as the delays are concerned for \ensuremath{\delta} and \ensuremath{\dot{\delta}} which are attributed to the muscle spindle sensors and for the torque feedback which is attributed to the golgi tendon organs  a delay of 25 \si{\milli\second} is chosen \cite{van2002identification,de2002adaptation}. For the feedback states attributed to visual feedback such as the roll angle \ensuremath{\phi} and yaw angle \ensuremath{\psi} a much greater delay of 200 \si{\milli\second} is chosen. Finally for  the vestibular roll rate feedback a delay of 50 \si{\milli\second} is implemented \cite{barnett2013vestibular}.

\section{Results}


\subsection{Zero Delay Model}
The results of the zero delay model for the median rider are presented in \cref{tb:no_delay}. A \ensuremath{\mathit{VAF}} of over 90 \% is easily achieved for both steer angle and heading, while for roll the discrepancy is larger. A  look into how the model approximates the measured rider input and bicycle states for the  forward speed of 2.8 \si{m.s^{-1}} is seen in \cref{fig:zdm_raw}. For a look into how the model approximates the response of the rider for all forward speeds refer to \cref{fig:zdm_fitA,fig:zdm_fitB}. Even in the ideal case with zero delays, the model inputs seems to lag behind the measured applied rider torque.

 \end{figure}


From the coefficient of variation, no real difference between the levels of normalized uncertainty is noted. However, \ensuremath{\mathit{VAF}_\delta} drops more than 15-20\% when \ensuremath{T_\delta} feedback is turned off (see \cref{tb:no_delay}), which indicates significant impact on the fit. Additionally,  the steering angle and torque response   becomes substancially more oscillatory when \ensuremath{{T_\delta}} feedback is turned off (see \cref{fig:paper6}). Roll stabilization performance does not seem to be affected, however steering effort considerably does. Regarding the haptics off case, where the intent is to simulate the steering feel the participants experienced in the second experimental condition, the level of steering fit degradation is small (\ensuremath{<3\%} see \ensuremath{3^{\text{rd}}} column of \cref{tb:no_delay}).

\end{figure}



\subsection{Variable Delay Model}
The same procedure is repeated for the gray box model but now introducing  delays in all feedback pathways. For \ensuremath{\delta} and \ensuremath{\dot{\delta}} which are attributed to the muscle spindle sensors and for the torque feedback which is attributed to the golgi tendon organs  a delay of 25 \si{\milli\second} is chosen \cite{van2002identification,de2002adaptation}. For the feedback states attributed to visual feedback such as the roll angle \ensuremath{\phi} and yaw angle \ensuremath{\psi} a much greater delay of 200 \si{\milli\second} is chosen \cite{kawakami2002visual}. Finally for  the vestibular roll rate feedback a delay of 50 \si{\milli\second} is implemented \cite{barnett2013vestibular}. 

The results of the variable delay model for the median rider are presented in \cref{tb:variable}.  Despite the fact that significant delay is introduced into the system the torque feedback loop manages to compensate maintaining a \ensuremath{\mathit{VAF}_\delta} of over 90 \% for low speed levels (see \cref{tb:variable}). In \cref{fig:dm_raw} the delayed response of the simulated compared to the real rider is visible between the red and blue lines in the rider torque graph. This is further exaggerated in the two remaining conditions resulting in much more oscillatory steering responses with a visible impact on roll stabilization (see \cref{fig:paper8}). The coefficient of variation of the \ensuremath{K_\delta} parameter in the haptics on with \ensuremath{T_\delta} feedback connected is the highest especially for the two highest speed levels, which indicates that this parameter is not significant for the fit. Between \ensuremath{{T_\delta}} feedback on and feedback off, a much larger drop in VAF is noted. Additionally, contrary to the zero delay model an equally significant drop in the fit is noted for the haptics off case (see \ensuremath{3^{\text{rd}}} column of \cref{tb:variable}).

\subsection{Variable Delay Reafferent Optimal Prediction  Model}

The VDROP model of  \cref{fig:paper4} is implemented with a variable  time delay among sensory pathways equal to the values used in the variable delay model. It is assumed that the internal model of bicycle and neuromuscular dynamics along with the internal model of the inherent time delay responsible for prediction is perfect for controlling the normal bicycle dynamics (\ensuremath{A^*=A_m^*}). However in the haptics off case, where the steering dynamics change, the internal model is not updated in simulation on purpose. This falls inline with what was noted during the experiments where the subjects adapted to the new bicycle dynamics instantaneously, so a full "re-calibration" of the forward model is too far fetched. This way the extent to which the smith prediction principle can counter forward model inaccuracies is also tested. 


The optimization results for the VDROP model are presented in \cref{tb:predict} for the median rider. From the \ensuremath{\mathit{VAF}s} and the signals shown in \cref{fig:ropm_raw} it is visible that the quality of the fit is comparable with the ideal zero delay case. In the haptics on with \ensuremath{{T_\delta}} feedback condition \ensuremath{K_{\dot{\delta}}} shows disproportionately higher CV which indicates lower importance for the fit for the steering rate feedback. However, in the haptics on without \ensuremath{ {T_\delta}} feedback case, the gain \ensuremath{K_{\delta}} shows the highest  uncertainty (see \cref{tb:predict}). Similar drop in \ensuremath{\mathit{VAF}_\delta} is present as in the zero delay model when  \ensuremath{{T_\delta}} feedback is turned off, which shows significant importance of the golgi tendon organ sensory pathway. Furthermore, the steering response exhibits  the same oscillatory behavior when torque feedback is completely disabled (see \cref{fig:paper10} ). However, the predictor manages to compensate in the haptics off case and achieve good fit which is not present in the variable delay model(see \cref{tb:predict}). In \cref{fig:gains_speed} the gains estimated for the median rider as a function of speed for all torque feedback conditions are presented. Consistent trends could only be discerned for the heading  gain \ensuremath{K_\psi}.

\end{figure}

In \crefrange{fig:results_compare12}{fig:results_compare34}  a complete comparison between rider models for all feedback conditions is presented. The response shown is the result of the first lateral perturbation of each individual run. The zero delay and prediction models exhibit almost identical responses as it was evident from the over 90\% fit achieved. The variable delay model lags behind in both the produced control input and bicycle output, as is expected. Worth noting the lag in the control input of the prediction model in the first few milliseconds after the perturbation. Despite that fact the VDROP model compensates and achieves similar output as the idealized zero delay case. This is a result of the fact that no matter how good the prediction algorithm is the human has no knowledge of the future so the response from the controller will start after the first state information arrives from the feedback pathways which are delayed. The forward model in this case does not help predict the state as it has no information of the external disturbance.

        \label{fig:results_compare34}
     \end{figure}
Finally, in order to assess the effectiveness of the predictor, the VDROP model is compared with an implementation of the prediction algorithm without the smith correction, meaning the predictor consists of just the adapted DOP (see \cref{fig:VDROP_line}). For the comparison the gains estimated from the zero delay model are used, so as to remove any potential adaptation that might give the VDROP model an advantage. The effect of the undelayed estimate using both approaches is seen in \cref{fig:predictor_compare}.


From the left plot of \cref{fig:predictor_compare} it is visible that the estimate of the state  improves due to the fact that the effect of the disturbance on the state albeit delayed is added back to the optimal prediction. Worth noting that both prediction strategies produce satisfactory results and manage to stabilize the system. However, the main advantage of  VDROP is its ability to correct for internal model inaccuracies. In \cref{fig:predictor_compareA} the results of a simulation using VDROP  model is compared with the results of the adapted DOP  but in this case internal model imperfections are introduced. This is done by replacing the perfect forward model with  the one used for the haptics off steering dynamics. The reasoning behind that is based on the assumption that the human has a reduced perception of bicycle dynamics that does not take into account the fact that roll also affects the state of the handlebar assembly.  In \cref{fig:predictor_compare2} it is visible that VDROP manages to achieve comparable performance to the perfect internal model case while adapted DOP fails. 

\subsubsection{Validation}
Similar to how the median rider of the trainning dataset is calculated, the median rider of the validation dataset is determined. The VDROP model with its estimated parameters is tested by determining the variance accounted for between the non-parametric response of the  validation dataset and the simulation output. The results can be seen in seen in \cref{tb:validation}. For a more detailed look into  how the simulated signals approximate the measured response refer to \cref{fig:ropm_valA,fig:ropm_valB} of \cref{ch:appD}.

    \caption{ Results for the variable delay model as estimated for the median rider for all speed levels. Results are presented for the three conditions. Haptic on/off differentiates based on the dynamics of the bicycle model, while "with or w/o \ensuremath{T_\delta} feedback" differentiates based on the structure of the rider control model. The values of the gains are presented as well as their corresponding uncertainty level measured by the coefficient of variation \ensuremath{CV_i}. Additionally, the variance accounted for of the orientation outputs between parametric and non parametric signals is also presented. The derivative gains (\ensuremath{K_{\dot{\phi}}},\ensuremath{K_{\dot{\delta}}}) are measured in \si{\kilogram\square\meter\per\second} while the proportional gains (\ensuremath{K_{\phi}},\ensuremath{K_{\delta}},\ensuremath{K_{\psi}}) are measured in \si{\kilogram\square\meter\per\square\second}. The torque feedback gain \ensuremath{K_{T_\delta}} is dimensionless.}

    \caption{ Results for the VDROP model as estimated for the median rider for all speed levels. Results are presented for the three conditions. Haptic on/off differentiates based on the dynamics of the bicycle model, while "with or w/o \ensuremath{T_\delta} feedback" differentiates based on the structure of the rider control model. The values of the gains are presented as well as their corresponding uncertainty level measured by the coefficient of variation \ensuremath{CV_i}. Additionally, the variance accounted for of the orientation outputs between parametric and non parametric signals is also presented. The derivative gains (\ensuremath{K_{\dot{\phi}}},\ensuremath{K_{\dot{\delta}}}) are measured in \si{\kilogram\square\meter\per\second} while the proportional gains (\ensuremath{K_{\phi}},\ensuremath{K_{\delta}},\ensuremath{K_{\psi}}) are measured in \si{\kilogram\square\meter\per\square\second}. The torque feedback gain \ensuremath{K_{T_\delta}} is dimensionless.}

%     \caption{ Results for the ROP model as estimated for the median rider for all speed levels. Results are presented for the three conditions. Haptic on/off differentiates based on the dynamics of the bicycle model, while "with or w/o \ensuremath{T_\delta} feedback" differentiates based on the structure of the rider control model. The values of the gains are presented as well as their corresponding uncertainty level measured by the coefficient of variation \ensuremath{CV_i}. Additionally, the variance accounted for of the orientation outputs between parametric and non parametric signals is also presented. The derivative gains (\ensuremath{K_{\dot{\phi}}},\ensuremath{K_{\dot{\delta}}}) are measured in \si{\kilogram\square\meter\per\square\second} while the proportional gains (\ensuremath{K_{\phi}},\ensuremath{K_{\delta}},\ensuremath{K_{\psi}}) are measured in \si{\kilogram\square\meter\per\second}. The torque feedback gain \ensuremath{K_{T_\delta}} is dimensionless.}

\section{Discussion}
In an effort to iterate over the rider control model of \citet{schwab2013} the VDROP model is created that manages to incorporate sensory time delays and strongly suggests towards the importance of torque feedback in the balancing task of cycling.  The VDROP model achieves high VAFs between its simulation output and the FIR filtered measured output across the four forward speed levels tested. Acceptable perfomance is also achieved when the model is tested with a validation dataset. 

Since in the control scheme the feedback is defined as negative, positive feedback gains produce torques opposite to the direction of the state that they act on. In that case a  positive \ensuremath{K_\delta} works like a normal restoring spring and  a positive \ensuremath{K_{\dot{\delta}}} as a dissipative damper. This was a design choice for all gains related to muscle spindles, in order to simulate lower spinal reflexes which  lead to increased stiffness and damping of the handlebar assembly. This is the reason the index of dispersion for the gain \ensuremath{K_\delta} is so large for the cases where the estimate is near zero (see \cref{tb:variable}). The gradient descent algorithm if left unbounded would result in values lower than zero which would lead to a physiologically impossible reflex response.  

On the other hand, the proportional and derivative roll gains  are consistently negative among all models for all forward speeds and all torque feedback level conditions. This falls in line with what is the main balancing strategy for single track vehicles; the so called "steer into the fall". Controller gain \ensuremath{K_\psi} always being negative means that the rider steers into the direction that heading is diverging, which  is due to the countersteering effect. Countersteering is used by single-track vehicle operators, such as cyclists and motorcyclists, to initiate a turn toward a given direction by momentarily steering counter to the desired direction. Gain \ensuremath{K_\psi} also exhibits a  consistent trend in all feedback conditions for all the rider models tested. It decreases as the forward speed increases (see \cref{fig:gains_speed}). This might indicate that heading is what modulates the response as forward speed increases. As  speed increases and the bicycle becomes more and more self stable the rider shifts focus towards heading correction and less towards roll stabilization. 

While the delayed control input  of the rider is expected in the variable delay model, a noticeable delay can be discerned even in the ideal zero delay model (see \cref{fig:zdm_fitB}). This occurs because  of the lag induced by the neuromuscular transfer function (see \cref{eq:gnmBLOCKA,eq:gnmBLOCKB}), the parameters of which do not seem to fall in line with the measured behavior as the response of the rider to the disturbance in the non-parametric model is much faster. 

Major discrepancies can be discerned in the non-parametric rider torque and the parametric torque for all models in the haptics off with \ensuremath{T_\delta} feedback condition (see \cref{fig:results_compare12,fig:results_compare34}). A choice was made to optimize the fit of the haptics off case with the non-parametric data-set of the haptics on condition, so as to make the impact of the change directly comparable. The non-parametric data-set of the haptics off experimental condition could have been used but that would invalidate the  purpose of the analysis, which is to see to what extent different torque feedback levels can approximate the same rider response. 

% One might question the arbitrary choice of 50 \si{\milli\second} for the delay in the ROP model. Attempts were made to increase it  up the more conservative estimate of 100 \si{\milli\second}. Fitting performance for higher delay values did not cause significant change in the \ensuremath{\mathit{VAF}s} but it did affect the rider input creating an input signal that had little resemblance with its non-parametric counterpart.   Physiologically the human is expected to first exhibit some kind of response due his fast reflexive pathways and later modulate that with its slower senses by applying what could be considered "control". When a  global delay is put into the sensory measurements it handicaps the controller by making the human unable to react to the disturbance for the amount of dead time.



While the assumption that steering is the only active control input for the task of bicycle roll stabilization is correct, a secondary task is not taken into account by leaving the upper body unconstrained, which revolves around balancing of the torso and head. As a result, \ensuremath{\mathit{VAF}_\phi} never reaches values higher than 85 \%. This assumption  was  confirmed by performing a non linear model simulation, where bicycle and rider where modeled as an inverted pendulum with torsional spring and dampers in the two hinges. It was found that when the rider-bicycle connection is compliant, the level of lean for the first overshoot reaction is larger  compared to the case where both pendulums are rigidly connected (see \cref{fig:dp_sim}). Consequently, the degree to which the rider can extrapolate information from their vestibular system to make deductions on the state of the bicycle is debatable, since the vestibular system measures roll rate and acceleration of the head and not the actual bicycle frame. However since this remains consistent among conditions, the effectiveness of the torque feedback loop will remain analogous acrross conditions.

A conclusion on the importance of \ensuremath{T_\delta} feedback can not be made by looking at the coefficient of variation, however the impact on fitting performance is significant. This is  indicated  by the fact that when the torque feedback loop is severed \ensuremath{\mathit{VAF}_\delta} drops by at least 15\% for all models tested. Even in the variable delay model, torque feedback is potent enough to compensate for the delays and achieve over 90 \% fit in steering response for the lower forward speeds (see \cref{tb:variable}). This could be, because torque inherently includes acceleration information and can give  the rider a preview of how the rest of the state is going to evolve. However, in the haptics off condition, where the torque feedback is not physiologically severed but lessened due to the changed steering dynamics,  major  degradation in fitting performance was only noted for the model with uncompensated time delays. In this case torque feedback is still proportional to the steering acceleration so the "preview" information is not completely lost. However the rider receives no input for the effect of the disturbance because the torque that would naturally transfer through the front wheel contact point is filtered by the uncoupled fork-handlebar connection.  Despite all that, in the VDROP model, \ensuremath{VAF_\delta} did not drop more than 8\% and \ensuremath{VAF_\phi}, \ensuremath{VAF_\psi} showed an even more insignificant drop, which could explain why no difference was found between steering configurations in the experiments conducted in \cite{dialynaseffect}. 

The pattern noted by the coefficient of variation of the derivative steering angle gain in the VDROP model indicates that when  \ensuremath{T_\delta} feedback  is present, the reflexive modulation of steering damping does not contribute to the successful rejection of lateral disturbances (see \cref{tb:predict}).  This was further confirmed by removing the \ensuremath{\dot{\delta}} feedback loop and noting that the \ensuremath{\mathit{VAF}_\delta} did not drop substancially (\ensuremath{< 1\%} see \cref{tb:reduced}) . However without \ensuremath{T_\delta} feedback,  it seems that \ensuremath{{\delta}} feedback becomes the least important for the fit (see \cref{tb:predict}). 


The  prediction strategy used  manages to utilize the smith  principle to enhance the optimal  predictions of the adapted DOP with  information of the effect of the disturbance on the state through reafferent pathways and simultaneously compensate for internal model inaccuracies. Note that in the haptics off case the internal mode was not updated to reflect the changed dynamics, but the predictor manages to filter out the small discrepancies by comparing the forward model output with the delayed state measurements. 

Given the above findings regarding the importance of torque feedback the VDROP model with \ensuremath{{T_\delta}} feedback in the haptics on configuration was tested against a validation dataset to ensure its prediction capability for a different set of measurements. By taking into consideration the level of inter subject variability that is present in all human related tasks the results are more than acceptable (see \cref{tb:validation}).


\section{Conclusions}
In an effort to iterate over existing rider control models, the VDROP model is created that successfully accounts for sensory delays by the use of an internal forward model. It is shown that implementation of delay without some compensation does not produce results that match the experimental data.  A prediction strategy is developed that manages to  circumvent the inability of the conventional smith predictor to work on inherently unstable open loop systems by implementing a resetting forward model (DOP). The results matched the  measured non-parametric outputs with a good level of fit. Additionally, the model is found to be robust towards internal model inaccuracies. 

Furthermore the importance of the sensory inflow from the golgi tendon organs was thoroughly examined. From the results it is therefore concluded that a proper rider control model should include the torque feedback pathway. Contrary to what  the results of the analysis done by \citet{dialynaseffect} indicated, this work suggests that torque feedback is in fact crucial to the execution of the balancing task. However the torque feedback in the experiments was not physiologically neutered and  state information could be deduced by the remaining inertial properties of the handlebar. Even though a steer-by-wire system decouples the roll and steer dynamics the remaining inertial feedback of the handlebar components (haptics off) was proven to be adequate for the rider to achieve comparable performance between conditions. Further, experiments with negative stiffness applied at the handlebars could be conducted to cancel out inertial steering effects to validate experimentally these results.
